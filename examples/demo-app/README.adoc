== Setting Up

The shadow-cljs compiler uses all cljsjs and NPM js dependencies through
NPM. If you use a library that is in cljsjs you will also have to add
it to your `package.json`.

You also cannot compile this project until you install the ones it
depends on already:

```
$ npm install
```

or if you prefer `yarn`:

```
$ yarn install
```

Adding NPM Javascript libraries is as simple as adding them to your
`package.json` file and requiring them! See the
[the Shadow-cljs User's Guide](https://shadow-cljs.github.io/docs/UsersGuide.html#_javascript)
for more information.

== Development Mode

Shadow-cljs handles the client-side development build. The file
`src/main/demo_app/client.cljs` contains the code to start and refresh
the client for hot code reload.

In general it is easiest just to run the compiler in server mode:

```
$ npx shadow-cljs server
INFO: XNIO version 3.3.8.Final
Nov 10, 2018 8:08:23 PM org.xnio.nio.NioXnio <clinit>
INFO: XNIO NIO Implementation Version 3.3.8.Final
shadow-cljs - HTTP server for :main available at http://localhost:8020
shadow-cljs - HTTP server for :test available at http://localhost:8022
shadow-cljs - HTTP server for :workspaces available at http://localhost:8023
shadow-cljs - server version: 2.7.2
shadow-cljs - server running at http://localhost:9630
shadow-cljs - socket REPL running on port 51936
shadow-cljs - nREPL server started on port 9000
...
```

then *navigate to the server URL* (shown in this example as http://localhost:9630) and
use the *Builds* menu to enable/disable whichever builds you want watched/running.

Shadow-cljs will also start a web server for any builds that configure one. This
template configures one for workspaces, and one for tests:

- Workspaces: [http://localhost:8023/workspaces.html](http://localhost:8023/workspaces.html)
- Tests: [http://localhost:8022](http://localhost:8022)

See the server section below for working on the full-stack app itself.

=== Client REPL

The shadow-cljs compiler starts an nREPL. It is configured to start on
port 9000 (in `shadow-cljs.edn`).

In IntelliJ: add a *remote* Clojure REPL configuration with
host `localhost` and port `9000`.

then something like:

```
(shadow/nrepl-select :main)
```

will connect you to the REPL for a specific build (NOTE: Make sure you have
a browser running the result, or your REPL won't have anything to talk to!)

If you're using CIDER
see [the Shadow-cljs User's Guide](https://shadow-cljs.github.io/docs/UsersGuide.html#_cider)
for more information.

=== The API Server

In order to work with your main application you'll want to
start your own server that can also serve your application's API.

Start a LOCAL clj nREPL in IntelliJ, or from the command line:

```bash
$ lein repl
user=> (start)
user=> (stop)
...
user=> (restart) ; stop, reload server code, and go again
user=> (tools-ns/refresh) ; retry code reload if hot server reload fails
```

The URL to work on your application is then
[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

Hot code reload, preloads, and such are all coded into the javascript.

IMPORTANT: The server comes pre-secured with CSRF protection. If you have
trouble getting the client to talk to the server make sure you've read
and understood the security section of the http://book.fulcrologic.com[
Developer's Guide].

=== Preloads

There is a preload file that is used on the development build of the
application `demo_app.development-preload`. You can add code here that
you want to execute before the application initializes in development
mode.

=== Fulcro Inspect

Fulcro inspect will preload on the development build of the main
application and workspaces.  You must install the plugin in Chrome from the
Chrome store (free) to access it.  It will add a Fulcro Inspect tab to the
developer tools pane.

== Tests

Tests are in `src/test`

```
src/test
└── demo_app
    ├── client_test_main.cljs     entry point for dev-mode client tests
    └── sample_spec.cljs          spec runnable by client and server.
```

You can write plain `deftest` in here, but it is preconfigured to use `fulcro-spec` as well.

=== Server tests:

Interacting with tests resuts via a browser (also allows test focusing, etc):

From a CLJ REPL:

```
user=> (start-server-tests) ; start a server on port 8888 showing the server tests
```

then navigate to [http://localhost:8888/fulcro-spec-server-tests.html](http://localhost:8888/fulcro-spec-server-tests.html)

If you'd instead like to see them pop up over and over again in a terminal:

```
lein test-refresh
```

If you're running an nREPL, you can also use editor/IDE integration to run them, as fulcro-spec
actually outputs `deftest` under the hood.

=== CI Tests

Use the Makefile target `tests`:

```
make test
```

You must have `npm` and Chrome installed. The tests use the `npm`
utility Karma for actually running the tests. This make target will run
both client and server tests.

== Workspaces

Workspaces is a project by nubank that has great support for Fulcro. It is similar
to devcards, but has a more powerful user interface, integration with Fulcro Inspect,
and much more.

The source directory for making additions to your workspace is `src/workspaces`.
Remember to add workspace files there, and then make sure to add
a require the for new namespace in the `workspaces.cljs` file.

=== Workspaces and CSRF

The server comes preconfigured with CSRF protection.  As such, a token must be
embedded in the HTML for a client to be able to connect.  If you want to run
full-stack Fulcro cards, then you'll need that token.

The middleware included in this template can serve a workspaces HTML page that
has the correct token. The URI is `/wslive.html`. So, if your server is configured
for port 3000 you'd access your workspaces via `http://localhost:3000/wslive.html`.

Be careful with production deployment.  You may want to disable this HTML file and
make sure your workspaces js file isn't deployed to production.

== Standalone Runnable Jar (Production, with advanced optimized client js)

```
lein uberjar
java -jar target/demo-app.jar
```
