WARNING: The project is currently pre-alpha/proof of concept. I you want to try it out just add it to you're deps.edn (fulcro 2.6.13 or newer required) or just run the application in the examples folder


# Fulcro-nav-router
Fulcro nav router is meant as a top level abstraction over fulcro, handling the nitty-gritty details of things like: html5 routing, code splitting, fulcro dynamic queries and providing a structure for common things related to routing: initial load, page metadata (title, description), loading co-located css and acl checks.

A benefit of having this structure is that it makes features like server side rendering & rote pre-load data trivial to implement.


# Getting started

=== Defining the routes

```
(def routes
  {:main    [["/" :home]
             ["/friends" :friends]
             ["/person/:id" :person-page]
             ["/about" :about]]
   :account [["/account/settings" :account-settings]]})

```
A map where the keys represent the module names. `:main` is reserved for the routes in the app the other keys are for code-splitting and have to match the key that you defined for the module.
The route params format is from https://github.com/metosin/reitit.

=== Linking route handlers to the components

```
(nav-router/init-module-routes :main {:home    HomePage
                                      :friends FriendsPage
                                      :about   AboutPage})
```
`:main` is a reserved key for the app routes. In the case of modules that loaded by the module loader this will also trigger the `(cljs-loader/set-loaded! module-key)`

=== Initializing the router

In the `client.js`. Make sure that the file that has `(nav-router/init-module-routes :main ...` is imported.

```
(fc/new-fulcro-client
  :started-callback (fn [{:keys [reconciler]}]
                      (nav-router/init-router {:reconciler reconciler
                                               :config     {:uri-routing-type :fragment}
                                               :routes     routes})
                      (nav-router/nav-to! "/"))
        ...)

```
Params

`:routes` the routes you defined

`:uri-routing-type` Can be one of:

- `:none` (will not update browser uri)
- `:normal` (normal html5 routing with paths like `/about/project`)
- `:fragment` (will add the `\#` before so you're routes will be like  `#/about/project`)


=== Adding the router to the Root component

You have to add the nav-router/RouterComponent in the Root just like any other `defsc`.

```
(ns my-ns
 (:require
    [fulcro-nav-router.core :as nav-router]
    ...))

(defsc Root [this {:keys [router]}]
  {:initial-state (fn [p]
                    {:router (prim/get-initial-state nav-router/RouterComponent {})})
   :query         [{:router (prim/get-query nav-router/RouterComponent)}]}
  (dom/div
   (nav-router/ui-router router)))

```

=== Defining you're route components

```
(ns ns-ns
 (:require
    [fulcro-nav-router.core :as nav-router :refer [defsc-route]]
    ...))

(defsc-route MyPage [this {:keys [router]}]
  {:initial-state  (fn [route-params]
                     ...)
   :query           [...]
   :ident           [:my-page :param/id]
   :on-before-enter (fn [{:keys [::nav/reconciler] :as payload}]
                       (prim/transact! reconciler `[(init-defaults)])

   )}
  (dom/div
   (nav-router/ui-router router)))

```

- `:initial-state` Will be called by the router passing the route-params as a parameter

Route components can be just normal defsc, but if you want the router lifecycle methods you should use the `defsc-route` macro

- `:on-before-enter` Is where you can add `prim/transact!`, `df/load`

=== Navigation, changing routes

The Router only listens browser back/foreword events (see http://html5doctor.com/history-api/#historical-events) the browser url changes are a side-effect of the router updates.

Changing the routes can be done by:

- `(nav-router/nav-to! "/your-path")` This will also update the browser url, if `:uri-routing-type` is not `:none`
- `(nav-router/nav-to* "/your-path")` Will only change the screen
- `(dom/a {:href "/friends" :onClick nav-router/hijack-link!} "text")` This utility method will add event.preventDefault and call nav-to! on the element.href


# Roadmap
- Checks for route->component setup
- Handle client-only initial page load based on current url
- Add page-metadata method
- Add acl-check method
- Add pre-load route data option
- Add middleware support for all router lifecycle-methods
- Add route load co-located css as middleware
- JVM server side rendering
- nodejs/nashorn/graaljs server side rendering
- Add proof of concept middleware implementing ideas in https://bit.ly/2SMShGj
